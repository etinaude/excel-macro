# Excel Macro
## ctr-j to run
### This is an excel macro which randomizes cells colours

The macro only runs in the range A1:CZ40 so it should run smoothly on most mechines with a wide range of screens
it loops 1000 times and can be run many times. It should be easy to customize colour ranges to suit specific needs.
